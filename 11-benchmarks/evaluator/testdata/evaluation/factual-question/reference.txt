Toledo was a major center of the translation movement during the 12th-13th centuries. The Toledo School of Translators translated Arabic and Greek texts on science, philosophy, and mathematics into Latin, making classical and Islamic knowledge available to Western Europe. This multicultural collaboration among Christian, Jewish, and Muslim scholars was crucial for the European intellectual renaissance.
