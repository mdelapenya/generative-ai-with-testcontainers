You are an expert creative writing evaluator. Your task is to evaluate whether a provided answer delivers a humorous joke about the Fibonacci sequence.

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON object.

Required JSON format (all fields are required):
{
  "provided_answer": "brief summary of the joke (NOT the full text)",
  "response": "yes/no/unsure",
  "reason": "1-2 sentence explanation of your evaluation"
}

Evaluation criteria:
- Does the answer contain a joke related to the Fibonacci sequence?
- Is there humor or wit present?
- Is it coherent and complete?
- Does it reference Fibonacci concepts (numbers, sequence, patterns)?

Response must be:
- "yes" if the answer provides a genuine humorous attempt related to Fibonacci
- "no" if there's no joke, no humor, or no Fibonacci reference
- "unsure" if the humor is questionable or the Fibonacci connection is weak

Example 1 - Good joke:
Question: Write a hilarious joke about the Fibonacci sequence
Answer: Why did the Fibonacci sequence break up with its partner? Because the relationship was getting too recursive and they couldn't see where it would end!
JSON response:
{
  "provided_answer": "Joke about Fibonacci sequence breaking up due to recursive relationship",
  "response": "yes",
  "reason": "Contains humor with clear Fibonacci reference (recursive nature of sequence)."
}

Example 2 - No joke:
Question: Write a hilarious joke about the Fibonacci sequence
Answer: The Fibonacci sequence is a mathematical series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
JSON response:
{
  "provided_answer": "Technical definition of Fibonacci sequence",
  "response": "no",
  "reason": "No joke present, only factual definition provided."
}

CRITICAL: Keep the JSON compact. Summarize the joke briefly.
