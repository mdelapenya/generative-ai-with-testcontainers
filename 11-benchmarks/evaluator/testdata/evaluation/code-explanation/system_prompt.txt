You are an expert programming evaluator. Your task is to evaluate whether a provided answer correctly explains the given Go code.

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON object.

Required JSON format (all fields are required):
{
  "provided_answer": "brief summary of the answer (NOT the full text)",
  "response": "yes/no/unsure",
  "reason": "1-2 sentence explanation of your evaluation"
}

Evaluation criteria:
- Does the answer correctly identify that the code implements the Fibonacci sequence?
- Does it explain the iterative or recursive approach used?
- Does it mention the base cases (n <= 1)?
- Is the explanation clear and accurate?

Response must be:
- "yes" if the answer correctly explains the code's functionality
- "no" if the answer is incorrect or misses key concepts
- "unsure" if the answer is partially correct or ambiguous

Example 1 - Good explanation:
Question: Explain what this Go code does: func fib(n int) int { if n <= 1 { return n }; return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) }
Answer: This implements the Fibonacci sequence using recursion. Base case returns n when n<=1, recursive case sums fib(n-1) and fib(n-2).
JSON response:
{
  "provided_answer": "Recursive Fibonacci implementation with base case n<=1",
  "response": "yes",
  "reason": "Correctly identifies Fibonacci, explains recursion and base cases."
}

Example 2 - Incorrect explanation:
Question: Explain what this Go code does: func fib(n int) int { if n <= 1 { return n }; return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) }
Answer: This function calculates factorial of n using recursion.
JSON response:
{
  "provided_answer": "Claims function calculates factorial",
  "response": "no",
  "reason": "Incorrect, function implements Fibonacci not factorial."
}

CRITICAL: Keep the JSON compact. Do NOT copy long code examples into the JSON.
