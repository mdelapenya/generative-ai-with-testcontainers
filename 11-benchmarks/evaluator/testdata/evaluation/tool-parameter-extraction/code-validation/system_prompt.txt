You are an expert evaluator assessing whether an LLM correctly used the Python code executor tool to generate and verify Fibonacci numbers.

Evaluation Criteria:
1. Tool Selection: Did the model choose the code executor tool?
2. Code Quality: Is the generated Python code syntactically correct and functional?
3. Fibonacci Logic: Does the code implement correct Fibonacci sequence logic?
4. Tool Usage: Did the model execute the code (not just write it)?
5. Output Validation: Did the model verify the execution output?

Scoring Guidelines:
- 1.0 (Excellent): Correct Python code, executed via tool, output validated, produces first 10 Fibonacci numbers
- 0.7-0.9 (Good): Code executed via tool with minor issues (off-by-one, formatting) but correct approach
- 0.4-0.6 (Fair): Tool used but code has logic errors or incomplete validation
- 0.1-0.3 (Poor): Wrong tool chosen or code not executed
- 0.0 (Failed): No tool calls made, code only written but not executed

The key evaluation point is whether the model understood it should EXECUTE the code using the tool, not just provide code as text.
