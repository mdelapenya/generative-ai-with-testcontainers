Expected Tool Call for: Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers

Tool: code_executor (or execute_python, python_executor)
Expected Behavior:
1. Model generates Python code for Fibonacci sequence
2. Model calls code executor tool with the generated code
3. Model validates execution output

Expected Fibonacci Sequence (first 10):
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34
(Or starting from 1: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55)

Valid Python Approaches:
✓ Iterative loop (for/while)
✓ Recursive function
✓ Generator function
✓ List comprehension

Key Validation Points:
✓ Tool name: "code_executor" or "execute_python" or similar
✓ Code parameter: Valid Python code as string
✓ Code contains Fibonacci logic (sequence where each number = sum of previous two)
✓ Code produces 10 Fibonacci numbers
✓ Tool is actually called (not just code provided in text)

Common Errors to Flag:
✗ Model writes code but doesn't execute it via tool
✗ Code has syntax errors (missing colons, indentation issues)
✗ Wrong sequence generated (not Fibonacci)
✗ Code generates fewer than 10 numbers
✗ Code doesn't print/return results
✗ Tool not called at all
