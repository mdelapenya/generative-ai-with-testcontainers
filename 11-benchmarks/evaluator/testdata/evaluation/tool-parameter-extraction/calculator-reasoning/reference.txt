Expected Tool Calls for: (125 * 47) + (980 / 20) - 156

Operation Breakdown:
1. multiply(125, 47) → 5875
2. divide(980, 20) → 49
3. add(5875, 49) → 5924
4. subtract(5924, 156) → 5768

Alternative Valid Sequences:
- Operations can be performed in different orders (e.g., divide first, then multiply)
- Intermediate results may vary based on sequence
- Final answer should be 5768

Key Validation Points:
✓ Tool name: "calculator" (or similar calculator tool)
✓ Operation parameter: One of ["multiply", "divide", "add", "subtract"]
✓ Numeric parameters: Match the original expression values
✓ Four distinct calculator calls (one per operation)
✓ Results feed into subsequent operations correctly

Common Errors to Flag:
✗ Model solves mentally without calling calculator
✗ Combines multiple operations into one call
✗ Incorrect operation names (e.g., "times" instead of "multiply")
✗ Swapped numeric arguments (e.g., divide(20, 980) instead of divide(980, 20))
✗ Missing operations (only 2-3 calls instead of 4)
