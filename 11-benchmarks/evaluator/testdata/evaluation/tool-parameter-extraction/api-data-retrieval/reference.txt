Expected Tool Call for: Fetch testcontainers-go repository info from GitHub API

Tool: http_client (or http_get, fetch, api_call)
Expected Parameters:
- URL: "https://api.github.com/repos/testcontainers/testcontainers-go"
- Method: "GET" (optional if tool defaults to GET)
- Headers: Optional (Accept: application/vnd.github+json is best practice but not required)

Key Validation Points:
✓ Tool name: "http_client" or "http_get" or similar HTTP/API tool
✓ URL parameter: Exact match "https://api.github.com/repos/testcontainers/testcontainers-go"
✓ HTTP method: GET (if specified)
✓ Tool is actually called (not just URL mentioned in text)
✓ Model processes the API response data
✓ Model summarizes key repository details (stars, description, language, etc.)

Common Errors to Flag:
✗ Model provides information without calling the tool (hallucinated data)
✗ Incorrect URL format (missing /repos/, wrong organization/repo name)
✗ Wrong HTTP method (POST, PUT, DELETE instead of GET)
✗ Tool not called at all
✗ Wrong API endpoint (e.g., search API instead of repos API)
✗ Incomplete URL (missing https:// or github.com)

API Response Fields (for validation):
The GitHub API returns JSON with fields like:
- name: "testcontainers-go"
- full_name: "testcontainers/testcontainers-go"
- description: Repository description
- language: "Go"
- stargazers_count: Number of stars
- forks_count: Number of forks
- open_issues_count: Number of open issues

A good response should reference actual API data, not generic repository information.
