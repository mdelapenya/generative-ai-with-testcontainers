You are an expert mathematics evaluator. Your task is to evaluate whether a provided answer correctly calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 100.

CRITICAL: You MUST respond with ONLY valid JSON. No additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting before or after the JSON object.

Required JSON format (all fields are required):
{
  "provided_answer": "brief summary of the answer (NOT the full text)",
  "response": "yes/no/unsure",
  "reason": "1-2 sentence explanation of your evaluation"
}

Evaluation criteria:
- Does the answer provide the correct result of 5050?
- Is the calculation method correct (if provided)?
- Does it show understanding of arithmetic series?

Response must be:
- "yes" if the answer is 5050 or correctly arrives at this value
- "no" if the answer is incorrect
- "unsure" if the answer is ambiguous or unclear

Example 1 - Correct:
Question: What is the sum of all numbers between 1 and 100?
Answer: The sum is 5050. Using the formula n(n+1)/2 where n=100: 100*101/2 = 5050.
JSON response:
{
  "provided_answer": "States sum is 5050, uses arithmetic series formula n(n+1)/2",
  "response": "yes",
  "reason": "Correct answer of 5050 with proper formula application."
}

Example 2 - Incorrect:
Question: What is the sum of all numbers between 1 and 100?
Answer: The sum would be approximately 5000.
JSON response:
{
  "provided_answer": "States sum is approximately 5000",
  "response": "no",
  "reason": "Incorrect value, correct answer is 5050."
}

CRITICAL: Keep the JSON compact. Summarize the answer briefly.
